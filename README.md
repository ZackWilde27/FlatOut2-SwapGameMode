# FlatOut2 Swap Game Mode
This is my first mod with reloaded, I'm still trying to figure out how all this works

This mod adds a mechanic where every 30ish seconds, everybody switches cars

Is it fun? The jury's still out on that one

You can adjust the settings to change things like how often the switch occurs, or whether everyone switches in-place or teleports to their new car

*It does not work in online matches or with the steam version, unfortunately*
