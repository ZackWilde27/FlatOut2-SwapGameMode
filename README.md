# FlatOut2 Swap Game Mode

The xNya version can be found [here](https://github.com/ZackWilde27/FlatOut2_SwapGameMode_xNya)

This mod adds a mechanic where every 30ish seconds, everybody switches cars

Is it fun? The jury's still out on that one

You can adjust the settings to change things like how often the switch occurs, or whether everyone switches in-place or teleports to their new car

*It does not work with the steam version, unfortunately*
